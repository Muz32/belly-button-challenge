In this assignment challenge, I built an interactive dashboard for data visualizations using JavaScript. This involved utilizing the JavaScript libraries Plotly and D3 (Data-Driven Documents). The dashboard dynamically represents data from a study examining microbial species found in human navel samples. For more information, please visit the [Rob Dunn Lab's Belly Button Biodiversity project page](https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity).

# Interactive Dashboard Access
 For an immersive experience, explore the data visualizations on the [Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard](https://muz32.github.io/belly-button-challenge).

**Navigating the Dashboard**:
- **Test Subject ID Number**: Located in the top left corner, the dropdown menu allows you to select different datasets corresponding to the participants of the study.
- **Instant Data Visualization**: Upon selecting an ID number, the dashboard will display the participant's demographic details, along with a bar chart and bubble chart showcasing the top 10 types and quantities of bacteria present in the sample size for that participant. 
- **Dynamic Updates**: The visualizations and information dynamically update with each new selection, providing a seamless exploration of the data.

# Files and Folders
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the dashboard and links to the JavaScript files for functionality.
- `samples.json`: Copy of Dataset used for the visualizations.
  - `static`(folder)
    - `js`(folder)
      - `app.js`: JavaScript code for rendering the visualizations on the dashboard.

# Source of Data
The data was provided by **edX Boot Camps LLC** and sourced from **The Public Science Lab, Department of Applied Ecology, North Carolina State University**.
